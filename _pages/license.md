# License

In order to protect my work, the hardware design files are currently only available under a non-commercial license. The non-commercial aspect will probably be lifted in the future, when I have decided if and how I want to commercialize the module. That being said, I'm absolutely fine with people selling PCBs and frontpanels for the production costs. If you want to build and sell more than a handful of modules, please contact me first.
